Welcome to MerAnO's documentation!
==================================


MerAnO is a python3 package created as part of the Bioinformatics master's degree in Bordeaux. MerAnO for "Merge & Analyze Organism" has two separate objectives.
 
 * Merge files in SBML format while modifying the identifiers. Thus, each "species" or "reaction" present in the final file is associated with an organism.
 * Analyze the modules present in a file in annotation format. The data required in KEGG allows the development of graphs illustrating the proportion of modules in each organization and compares the modules of the organizations included in the analysis.
